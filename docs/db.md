# Database Utilities Module

## Overview
The `db_utils` module provides functions to manage interactions with the database, such as managing projects, files, scrolls, and prompts. These operations use SQLx for database queries.

It is divided into the following sub-modules:
- `project`: Handles Project-related CRUD operations.
- `file`: Handles file-related CRUD operations.
- `scroll`: Handles Scroll-related management and updates.
- `prompt`: Handles Prompt-related operations for scroll workflows.
