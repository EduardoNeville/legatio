### Demo

#### Projects

[![Projects](https://asciinema.org/a/722660.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/722660)

- Start `legatio`
- Select `[n]` to add a new project (chose relevant code or root directory of project)
- Use `[s]` to select an existing project
- Use `[d]` to delect an existing project

#### Scrolls

[![Scrolls](https://asciinema.org/a/722672.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/722672)

- Press `[e]` or `[s]` as guided to enter the scrolls menu
- Add (`[n]`) or delete (`[d]`) context files as needed
- Scrolls can be code, markdown, text files, etc.

#### Branching

- In your project, select prompts to chain or create new ones
- Prompts serve as AI instructions
- Chaining allows you to build iterative workflows

#### Query your model

- With prompts and context/scrolls selected, 
- Write your prompt into the legatio.md file in the directory you created
- Press `[a]` to ‚ÄúAsk Model‚Äù
- Confirm `[y]`
- The AI‚Äôs response is saved in history and can seed new prompts


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

On first run, `legatio` creates a config directory `~/.config/legatio`.  
In the `config.toml` you can configure:
- Default LLM backend/model (e.g., openai/anthropic and the model name: gpt-4.1)
- Preferred color theme (Tokyo Storm, etc)
- API keys/secrets (handled securely)

## üí° Tips

- Keyboard navigation: UI hints always in the top bar
- Errors are clearly displayed in the terminal
- Want to start fresh with a different project? `[p]` to switch

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

Your API keys are only stored locally and never sent elsewhere.  
Project data lives on your disk in your chosen work folder.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Plans

- Scroll through the prompts and scrolls
- Select multiple scrolls (adding & deleting)
- Processing other file formats like (PDFs)
- Hidden files
